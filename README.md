# Public scripts created by Samuel Curtis
SACMES stands for Simultaneous Analysis and Control of Electrochemical Systems.

Each script analyzes data from specific electrochemical techniques in real time and exports the data into space delimited txt files. Each script runs off of an multithreaded animation module I created known as ElectrochemicalAnimation and can analyze any number of electrodes.

# SACMES_SWV.py #
SACMES_SWV analysis data from Square-Wave Voltammograms and offers real time control of data analysis.

# SACMES_CV.py #
SACMES_CV analyzes data from Cyclic Voltammgrams

# SACMES_CA.py
SACMES_CA analyzes data from Chronoamperograms

# SACMES_LovricAnalysis.py #
SACMES_LovricAnalysis analyzes Square-Wave Voltammograms to find optimal on/off frequencies for E-AB biosensors. This is also known as "frequency map analysis" and animates data in a Lovric Plot.
